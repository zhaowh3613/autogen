Here\u2019s an example of how you might set up and use Spark with FLAML for AutoML tasks:\n\nFirstly, ensure that you have the Spark cluster set up and the `pyspark` and `joblib-spark` packages installed in your environment. You can install the required packages using pip if they are not already installed:\n\n```python\n!pip install flaml pyspark joblib-spark\n```\n\nHere\'s a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to use FLAML with Spark for parallel training:\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import AutoML\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nfrom joblibspark import register_spark\n\n# Initialize a Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master("local[*]") \\\n    .appName("FLAML_Spark_Example") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\n# Register the joblib spark backend\nregister_spark()  # This registers the backend for parallel processing\n\n# Load sample data\nX, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)\n\n# Initialize an AutoML instance\nautoml = AutoML()\n\n# Define the settings for the AutoML run\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 60,  # Total running time in seconds\n    "metric": \'accuracy\',  # Primary metric for evaluation\n    "task": \'classification\',  # Task type\n    "n_jobs": -1,  # Number of jobs to run in parallel (use -1 for all)\n    "estimator_list": [\'lgbm\', \'rf\', \'xgboost\'],  # List of estimators to consider\n    "log_file_name": "flaml_log.txt",  # Log file name\n}\n\n# Run the AutoML search with Spark backend\nautoml.fit(X_train=X, y_train=y, **settings)\n\n# Output the best model and its performance\nprint(f"Best ML model: {automl.model}")\nprint(f"Best ML model\'s accuracy: {automl.best_loss}")\n\n# Stop the Spark session\nspark.stop()\n```\n\nThe `register_spark()` function from `joblib-spark` is used to register the Spark backend with joblib, which is utilized for parallel training within FLAML. The `n_jobs=-1` parameter tells FLAML to use all available Spark executors for parallel training.\n\nPlease note that the actual process of setting up a Spark cluster can be complex and might involve additional steps such as configuring Spark workers, allocating resources, and more, which are beyond the scope of this code snippet.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need to adjust configurations for your specific Spark setup, please refer to the Spark and FLAML documentation for more details.\n\nWhen you run the code, ensure that your Spark cluster is properly configured and accessible from your Python environment.

Give me sample code.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below.

You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.\nRule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:\n```language\n# your code\n```\n\nUser\'s question is: How to use spark for parallel training in FLAML? Give me sample code.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs.

Set `use_spark` to `True` for parallel tuning.\n\nHere\'s a sample code demonstrating how to use Spark for parallel training in FLAML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\n# Sample data in a pandas DataFrame\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n\n# Prepare features using VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n\n# Initialize AutoML\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\n\n# Configure settings for AutoML\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,  # time budget in seconds\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # using Spark ML estimators\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,  # number of parallel trials\n    "use_spark": True,  # enable parallel training using Spark\n    "force_cancel": True,  # force cancel Spark jobs if time_budget is exceeded\n}\n\n# Start the training\nautoml.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label, **settings)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- The `to_pandas_on_spark` function is used to convert the pandas DataFrame to a pandas-on-spark DataFrame.\n- `VectorAssembler` is used to transform feature columns into a single vector column.\n- The `AutoML` object is created, and settings are configured for the AutoML run, including setting `use_spark` to `True` for parallel training.\n- The `fit` method is called to start the automated machine learning process.\n\nBy using these settings, FLAML will train the models in parallel using Spark, which can accelerate the training process on large models and datasets.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"Number of requested results 3 is greater than number of elements in index 1, updating n_results = 1\nModel gpt4-1106-preview not found.
